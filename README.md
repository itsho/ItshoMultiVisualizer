ItshoMultiVisualizer is a visualizer for Visual Studio 2010, for as much as possible data objects.

Main target: Replace Original DataSet/DataTable/DataView visualizer with a faster and more stable one.
Second target: is to make it easly extended by any user, and to be as stable as possabile.
Third target: add visualizer with reflection to any object. NOT like Mole (C), but at least 2 level of nesting.

anyone who want to join/develop/give advice/require ability or any other thing you have in mind, is more than invited.
